        <h3>@JoeyStockton7</h3>
        <p>Founder & CEO</p>
        <p>I'm Joey Favazzo, a dedicated trader with over four years of active trading experience and more than six years of analyzing market charts. Specializing in intraday scalping while incorporating strategic swing trades, I focus on precision, discipline, and risk management to navigate the markets effectively. My passion for trading is driven by my family—my five siblings and the two greatest parents—who inspire me to push forward every day. Through my journey, I aim to share valuable insights, help others grow in the market, and continue refining my craft in the pursuit of financial freedom.</p>

        <h3>@JoeyStockton7</h3>
        <p>Lead Educator</p>
        <p>What sets me apart as an educator is the journey I've taken to get here. Trading has been a path filled with hard-learned lessons—countless losses that became my greatest teachers, years of backtracking my strategy to refine what truly works, and an in-depth study of every indicator I use. I’ve built extensive knowledge not just by understanding the technical side of trading, but by learning how to simplify it. My goal is to take complex concepts and break them down into a format that is easy to grasp, helping others accelerate their learning curve and avoid the same pitfalls I once faced. Whether you're new to the markets or looking to sharpen your skills, I’m here to provide clear, actionable guidance that can take your trading to the next level.</p>

        <p>Technical Analyst Tools</p>
        <p>Successful trading starts with a well-structured approach to technical analysis, and my strategy is built on a combination of proven indicators and price action techniques. Every trade setup I analyze is guided by a blend of momentum tracking, trend identification, and key level confirmations to maximize precision and probability.

I utilize Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs – 9, 21, 30, 200) to assess short-term momentum shifts and overall trend direction. The VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) serves as a critical benchmark for institutional positioning, helping identify high-probability entry and exit points. Fibonacci Extensions allow me to project potential price targets based on market structure, while zones and key levels provide a strong foundation for identifying areas of significant buying or selling pressure.

By combining these tools, I develop a clear picture of market sentiment, ensuring that every trade is backed by confluence and logic rather than emotion. My focus is on refining setups with precision, staying patient for confirmation, and executing trades with confidence.</p>
